## Database Models

The main entities and their relationships are:

- **User**: Job seeker, can apply to jobs and chat with recruiters.
- **Recruiter**: Can post jobs and chat with users.
- **Job**: Posted by a recruiter, can have multiple applications.
- **Application**: Created by a user for a job, has a 1:1 relationship with ResumeScore.
- **ResumeScore**: AI-generated score for an application.
- **Chat**: Between a user and a recruiter, contains messages.

See the ER diagram for details.

## API Modules

- **User APIs**: Registration, login, logout, profile, password reset ([routes/user.routes.js](routes/user.routes.js))
- **Recruiter APIs**: Registration, login, logout, profile, password reset ([routes/recruiter.routes.js](routes/recruiter.routes.js))
- **Job APIs**: CRUD for jobs ([routes/job.routes.js](routes/job.routes.js))
- **Application APIs**: Apply to jobs, manage applications ([routes/application.routes.js](routes/application.routes.js))
- **Resume Score APIs**: Generate and fetch resume scores ([routes/resume.routes.js](routes/resume.routes.js))
- **Chat APIs**: Create chat, send messages ([routes/chat.routes.js](routes/chat.routes.js))

## Setup & Running

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**  
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values (see below).

3. **Start the server:**
   ```sh
   npm run server
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend folder with the following keys:

```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address
GMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Note:**  
- Most routes require authentication via JWT in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.
- See the respective route files in [`routes/`](routes/) for validation and detailed logic.


## Notes

- Resume files are stored in `uploads/resumes/`.
- All API endpoints are prefixed (e.g., `/users`, `/jobs`, `/applications`, etc.).
- Authentication uses JWT in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.
- See individual route files for detailed API endpoints.
